# Information-Retrieval-System-for-Taxi-Drivers
This project was worked on and completed by the combined effort of Nicole Francolini, Nicole Gravagna, Herbert Gonzalez, Harshini Arumugam and Ashwathi Nair.
# Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline using New York City Taxi and Zone datasets
Created an information retrieval system using Flask in Python, Spark and SQL that processed over 31 million records of trips data from these sources and gave real-time information. This application can be scaled up to help taxi drivers optimize their earnings through tips.
